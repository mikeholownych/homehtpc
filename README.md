# :wave: Welcome, supporters!

## What is this?

This repository contains the homehtpc docker-compose for my personal htpc docker build.

This is a work in progress. As this is a new project for me, things will be changing quite frequently.

## How do I use this?

1. ```git pull git@github.com:mikeholownych/homehtpc.git```.
2. cd homehtpc
3. cp .env-example .env
4. vim .env (edit the file for your environment)
5. docker-compose up -d


### Can I contribute fixes etc?

Of course! Submit a PR, we'll go from there!
